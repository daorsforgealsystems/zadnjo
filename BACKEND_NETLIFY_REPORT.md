# Backend Report: Netlify Integration

## Overview

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the current backend architecture and its integration with Netlify for the Flow Motion logistics platform. The platform consists of a React frontend deployed on Netlify and a microservices backend (LogiCore) that can be deployed independently.
