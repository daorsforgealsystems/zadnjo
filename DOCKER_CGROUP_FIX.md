# Resolving Docker Daemon Start Failure: "devices cgroup is not mounted"

## 1. Understanding the Error

This error indicates that the Docker daemon cannot start because a required kernel feature, specifically the **devices cgroup**, is not enabled or mounted on your host system.

### What are cgroups?

**Control Groups (cgroups)** are a Linux kernel feature that allows processes to be organized into hierarchical groups. These groups can then be used to manage and limit the system resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network, etc.) that the processes within them can consume.

### Why does Docker need the 'devices cgroup'?

Docker leverages cgroups extensively to enforce resource constraints on containers. The **'devices' cgroup** is particularly important because it allows Docker to control which block and character devices a container can access. This is a critical security feature that prevents a container from, for example, accessing a hard drive or a webcam on the host machine without explicit permission.

When the Docker daemon starts, it checks for the availability of the 'devices cgroup' to ensure it can manage device access for its containers. If this cgroup is not mounted, Docker fails to start because it cannot guarantee the isolation and security it is designed to provide.

## 2. Step-by-Step Solution

The most common reason for this cgroup not being mounted is that the necessary kernel parameters are not set in the bootloader configuration. The solution involves updating the **GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader)** configuration to enable these parameters at boot time.

### Step 1: Open the GRUB Configuration File

You will need to edit the main GRUB configuration file with root privileges. Open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
```
*(You can replace `nano` with your preferred text editor, such as `vim` or `gedit`)*

### Step 2: Modify the Kernel Boot Parameters

In the editor, locate the line that starts with `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX`. It will look something like this:

```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="quiet splash"
```

You need to add `systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=0` to this line, inside the quotes. This parameter tells the system to use the older cgroup v1 hierarchy, which is often required for compatibility with certain Docker setups.

After modification, the line should look like this:

```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="quiet splash systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=0"
```

### Step 3: Save the Configuration and Update GRUB

After adding the parameter, save the file and exit the editor.
- In `nano`, press `Ctrl + X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`.

Now, you need to apply these changes to the GRUB boot configuration. Run the following command:

```bash
sudo update-grub
```

This command will regenerate the GRUB configuration files with your new settings.

### Step 4: Reboot the System

For the kernel parameter changes to take effect, you must reboot your machine.

```bash
sudo reboot
```

### Step 5: Verify the Solution

After the system reboots, the Docker daemon should be able to start successfully. You can verify its status with:

```bash
sudo systemctl status docker
```

If the service is running, the issue is resolved.
